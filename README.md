# libft ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º (passed 125/100)


My `libft` stuff for `42`. This is the code I've submitted for eval, I've 
gone through and commented the shit out of it so I (and anyone else trawling 
through this) can remember/figure out what I was thinking when I wrote it 
all. I'll also be gradually adding other stuff as I go along and build up
the library. Good luck to everyone doing this project, I hope you can find 
some helpful stuff in here.
